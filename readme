Basiclly: this helps you click the DBD bloodweb so you dont have to

u will need python 3 with pip enabled

steps:

1: clone this repo and go into the directory (on a terminal). Alternatavely, you can just download executeLazyClick.py and requirements.txt and utils.py and put them in one folder. U can then use command prompt or the one for mac.
2: run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" or "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install required packages (np, opencv, matplotlib, pyautogui)
3: OPen dead by daylight and have the bloodweb open (also make sure your screen resolution is 1080p or 2k cuz im not making changes for other resolutions)

IMPORTANT: make sure your most recent window is DBD or else the program may do unexpected things
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT: The program must be manually stopped (use control C on the terminal) OR ELSE YOUR MOUSE WILL KEEP CLICKING

4: Run the python file "executeLazyClick.py". Do this by typing "python executeLazyClick.py" or "python3 executeLazyClick.py" or "py executeLazyClick.py"
5: USE CONTROL C on the TERMINAL whenever u want to stop. remember, alt tab to swtich windows.
The script will begin running

How it works:
    first it takes a screenshot
    then it crops out the right side of the screen
    it uses an hsv mask to reveal circles better
    then it uses hough circles alrightom to find the current avalible items to buy
    Randomly selects an item and moves mouse to center coordinate and perfiorm a long click
    repeat

.dev:
    update selection algothim
    terminate script properly
    error handling
    refactorign
    find, non available items
    predict entity spawn
